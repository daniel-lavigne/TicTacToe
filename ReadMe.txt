To run Tic-Tac-Toe, first open the tictactoe.jar file. You will be prompted to select whether or not 
you wish to host the server. Selecting yes will open two window, one being the game and chat window, the 
other being the server window. Begin by going to the server window and clicking the start button. This will 
start the server. Next, go to the game window, enter your ip address in the text box on the bottom left
and click "Connect". This will add you to the queue of players waiting for a match. If you chose not to 
host the server, simply enter the ip address of the server into the bottom right text box and click connect.
Once you have connected to another player, it is time to start playing. Player one (chosen by the server)
will have the first move. Once one player has won or if their is a tie, the game will ask you if you wish
to play again. If yes, a new game will be started against your opponent with the victor of the previous 
game having the first move. In the event of a tie, the player who played last would go first in the new
game. Should you not wish to continue to a new game, you will be disconnect from the server and must 
reconnect in order to play again. Should your opponent disconnect, you will be notified and asks whether
you wish to keep playing. Selecting yes will connect you to another player, while selecting no will 
disconnect you from the server. To stop the server, simply close either the server window or your 
game window (only if you are hosting the server).

It is also possible to chat with your opponent once you have been connected. To chat, simply type a 
message into the text box in the upper right hand corner of the game window and click send.
